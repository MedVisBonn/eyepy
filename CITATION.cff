abstract: >-
  Eye imaging data from different device vendors
  often come in different file formats. Additionally,
  public datasets often have their own way of storing
  data for distribution. The lack of documentation
  for many device-specific formats is a problem
  already when working with a single data source
  while the pure amount of different formats slows
  down everyone trying to use data from multiple
  sources.

  This Python package aims at providing a unified
  interface to a wide variety of eye imaging formats
  and the execution of standard tasks such as data
  visualization and quantification on ETDRS grids.
  Thereby, it enables the development of
  device-independent software and algorithms.
