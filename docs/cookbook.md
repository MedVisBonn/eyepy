Here you learn how to use eyepy to perform common tasks.

## Import OCT data

Currently `eyepy` supports the HEYEX E2E, VOL and XML formats, as well as reading data from several public OCT datasets. All functions return a single `EyeVolume` object representing the data. E2E files may contain several OCT volumes. The import function only returns the first OCT volume in the file. If you want to read several volumes from a file use the [HeE2eReader][eyepy.io.he.e2e_reader.HeE2eReader] class. While you can use Reader objects to parse the data and access specific information, it is recommended to use when possible, the provided import functions to get `EyeVolume` object which are a convenient interface to the data that provides a unified interface to data imported from various sources.

```python
import eyepy as ep
# Import HEYEX E2E export
ev = ep.import_heyex_e2e("path/to/file.e2e")
# Import HEYEX XML export
ev = ep.import_heyex_xml("path/to/folder")
# Import HEYEX VOL export
ev = ep.import_heyex_vol("path/to/file.vol")
# Import Topcon FDA export (requires: pip install eyepy[fda])
ev = ep.import_topcon_fda("path/to/file.fda")
# Import volume from Duke public dataset
ev = ep.import_duke_mat("path/to/file.mat")
# Import volume form RETOUCH challenge (requires: pip install eyepy[itk])
ev = ep.import_retouch("path/to/volume_folder")
```

!!! Warning "Missing scale information"
    For the E2E file the scale of both localizer axes as well as the B-scan x-axes has not been identified yet and is hardcoded. When importing B-scans from folders there is also no scale information available.

When only B-scans exist in a folder `eyepy` might still be able to import them. B-scans are expected to be ordered and distributed with equal distance on a quadratic area.

```python
import eyepy as ep
# Import B-scans from folder
ev = ep.import_bscan_folder("path/to/folder")
```

Public OCT datasets often have their own data formats. `eyepy` can import volumes from the [AMD Dataset from Duke University](https://people.duke.edu/~sf59/RPEDC_Ophth_2013_dataset.htm) and the [RETOUCH Challenge](https://retouch.grand-challenge.org/).

```python
import eyepy as ep
# Import DUKE volume
ev = ep.import_duke_mat("path/to/volume.mat")
# Import RETOUCH volume
ev = ep.import_retouch("path/to/folder")
```

When you don't hava a supported OCT volume at hand you can check out our sample dataset to get familiar with `eyepy`.
```python
from eyepy.data import load
# Import HEYEX XML export
ev = load("drusen_patient")
```

## Plot Localizer

Most OCT volumes come with a localizer image. This image can be plotted using the `plot` method of the `EyeVolume` object:

```python
ev.plot()
```

There are several options to customize the plot:
    + show B-scan positions or region (`bscan_positions` and `bscan_region` parameters)
    + show enface projections or quantifications of OCT voxel annotaions such as drusen (`projections` and `quantifications` parameters)
    + show only a specific region of the localizer image (`region` parameter)

The plotting function is documented here: [EyeVolume.plot][eyepy.core.EyeVolume.plot]

!!! Warning "`region` parameter"
    The region parameter produces unexpected results in combination with `bscan_positions` and `bscan_region` parameters

## Plot Bscans

B-scans can be plotted using the `plot` method of the `EyeBscan` object. You get `EyeBscan` objects by indexing the `EyeVolume` object or iterating over it. The following code plots the first B-scan of the volume together with the layer annotations for BM and RPE:

``` python
ev[0].plot(layers=["BM", "RPE"])
```

The plotting function is documented here: [EyeBscan.plot][eyepy.core.EyeBscan.plot]

## Modify Annotations

### Compute Drusen from Layer Annotations

Here we compute drusen for our sample data which has manual layer annotations for BM and RPE.

``` python
import eyepy as ep

# Import example data
ev = ep.data.load("drusen_patient")
# Compute drusen
drusen_map = ep.drusen(ev.layers["RPE"].data, ev.layers["BM"].data, ev.shape, minimum_height=2)
```

### Add / Remove Layer Annotations
Often OCT volumes come with layer annotations. They are added to the `EyeVolume` object during the import, but you can also manipulate them yourself using the `add_layer_annotation` and `remove_layer_annotation` methods. The following code can be used to layer annotations to `EyeVolume` objects. The `name` parameter is used to identify the layer.

```python
layer_heights = np.zeros(np.array(ev.shape)[[0,2]])
ev.add_layer_annotation(layer_heights, name="new_layer")
```

To remove a layer annotation use the `remove_layer_annotation` method. The following code removes the layer annotation we added above.

```python
ev.remove_layer_annotation("new_layer")
```

### Add / Remove Voxel Annotaitons
If you want to add voxel annotations to the EyeVolume object you can use the `add_pixel_annotation` method. The following code adds the drusen map we computed above to the EyeVolume object. The `name` parameter is used to identify the annotation.

```python
ev.add_pixel_annotation(drusen_map, name="drusen")
```

To remove an annotation use the `remove_pixel_annotation` method. The following code removes the drusen annotation we added above.

```python
ev.remove_pixel_annotation("drusen")
```

### ETDRS and Custom Quantification Grids

Quantifications on circular grids such as the ETDRS grid are common to quantify imaging data of the eye. With `eyepy` you can easily compute quantifications on such grids. The following code computes a quantification grid for the drusen annotation we added above.

```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(5, 10))

# Configure quantification grid for drusen quantification
ev.volume_maps["drusen"].radii = [1.5, 2.5]
ev.volume_maps["drusen"].n_sectors = [4, 8]
ev.volume_maps["drusen"].offsets = [0, 45]

# Plot drusen projection and quantification
ev.plot(ax=axes[0], projections=["drusen"])
ev.plot(ax=axes[1], quantification="drusen")
axes[0].axis("off")
axes[1].axis("off")
```

The result looks like this: On the left, the scale is the drusen height in voxel and on the right, the drusen volume in mmÂ³

To access the quantification as a dictionary use `ev.volume_maps["drusen"].quantification`

### Interact with individual B-scans
If you index into an EyeVolume object you get EyeBscan objects. Annotations you added to the respective `EyeVolume` object are also available in the `EyeBscan` object and can be visualized easily. The following code plots the 40th B-scan of the volume together with the layer annotations for BM and RPE and the computed drusen annotation:

```python
import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(9,3))
bscan = ev[40]
bscan.plot(layers=["BM", "RPE"], areas=["drusen"], region=np.s_[150:300, :], ax=ax)
ax.axis("off")
```
